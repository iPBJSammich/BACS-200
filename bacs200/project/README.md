Hey Everyone!

The site itself is pretty self-explanatory, and is all up-to-date and finished as of Friday at 0200 MST. There are more details in the "From the Developer" section, including a run-down of how I completed this task.

I have accomplished what I set out to do when I made this website: properly use my Pokemon database in a real-world application. All project goals, minus Social Media Buttons, have been completed. It seems inappropriate for a project like this, as I'm simply the guy that put all this information together.

Thank you for checking me out!
