        Hey everyone!<br>
        <br>
    </h2>
    <h2 style="font-size:16; width:700px;">
        My name is Erik Halenkamp, and here's a bit about me if you didn't know me already. I'm currently a Sophomore at UNC studying Software Engineering. Colorado is where I've called home for nearly 10 years now. This project was completed in part due to a database I've been building up all semester in Java, and I've been able to use it for tons of different assignments in CS200. The database has grown from humble beginnings to an elaborate archive using dozens of csv documents, using the help of an online Pok&eacute;dex called <a href="https://veekun.com">"veekun"</a> <a href="https://github.com/veekun/pokedex">(Github)</a>. I wanted to apply this database to my final project for this course, but I had no idea how I'd go about doing it.
        <br>
        <br>
        At first I tried implementing it with Javascript, but this proved to be an incredibly difficult task. Not being familiar with the language definitely hurts, but it would've taken a long time regardless to get everything transferred over properly. Luckily, I'm able to perform most any data manipulation I want using what I had in Java, so I stuck with that. I quickly learned how to use File Output in Java, and soon enough, I had the power to create massive amounts of files with the click of a button.
        <br>
        <br>
        Creating the individual .html files for every Pok&eacute;mon I had stored was simple enough, but the hard part was populating them with functioning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I edited Bulbasaur's .html endlessly until I had a template that I could instruct my Java program to fill for each, individual Pok&eacute;mon. It took a lot of tweaking, but eventually it was accurate enough to publish with pride.
        <br>
        <br>
        That said, I'm not a professional Software Engineer. My database, though elaborate, is still lacking in some areas due to presence of information. Most notably, every Pok&eacute;mon that debuted after Generation VI is missing a Pok&eacute;dex blurb, as are most alternate forms. Some, more notable cases, are even missing their Abilities and Movesets. These errors are relatively uncommon, but given the scope of this project and the rest of my academic life at the moment, there are no plans to fix these individual errors leading up to the due date. Unfortunately, I have to hope you all will be satisfied with something less-than-perfect.
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope you all did well on your individual projects. Stay safe during this tough time!
