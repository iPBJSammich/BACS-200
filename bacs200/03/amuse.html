        <h2>Amusement #1 - Mountains</h2>
        <img src="images/mountains.jpg" alt="Image" height="300" width = "700">
        <p>I'm of the humble opinion that we live in the best state in the nation, and it's pretty easy to see why. The mountains, I feel, are a big part of that as Colorado's biggest identifying factor. I'm always going to love the mountains. </p>
        <h2>Amusement #2 - League of Legends</h2>
        <img src="images/darkstar.jpg" alt="Image" height="300" width="700">
        <p>Depending on the day and my mood, League of Legends can be a pretty fun game, and the art that comes out of it is absolutely stunning. However, this is often overlooked in the sheer frustration that comes with playing the game. I suppose that's just how it is. </p>
        <h2>Amusement #3 - Architecture</h2>
        <img src="images/architecture.jpg" alt="Image" height="300" width="700">
        <p>Architecture is an old passion of mine, and while I've long since moved on, I still like to peek now and then at certain concepts that might not be too far off in the future. While I don't have a special eye for the craft, it's still intriguing to see every now and then. </p>
